# ISRI-PQC
This profile collects and presents subset of our codebase related to our Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) research & development activities at the Information Security Research Department at [Cybernetica AS](https://cyber.ee/research).

We focus on PQC research (multiparty-computation and zero-knowledge schemes) as well as engineering aspects of PQ implementation in existing applications. This profile contains repositories which contain proof-of-concepts connected to our whitepapers or PQ-ized forks of existing GitHub repositories
