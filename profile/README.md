# About
This profile collects and presents subset of our codebase related to Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC) research & development activities at the [Information Security Research Department](https://cyber.ee/research), Cybernetica AS, Estonia.

We focus on PQC research (multiparty-computation and zero-knowledge schemes) as well as engineering aspects of PQ implementation in existing applications. This profile contains repositories with proof-of-concepts related to our whitepapers or PQ-ized forks of existing GitHub repositories.
